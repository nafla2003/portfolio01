Portfolio — Fathima Nafla

Files created:
- index.html — main single-page site
- css/style.css — styles and responsive design
- js/script.js — smooth scroll, theme, form handling

What's new:
- Expanded About section with a strong headline.
- Education timeline and more details.
- Projects with cards and a modal for details.
- Expanded Skills with tech badges and percentages.
- Improved UI animations, mobile nav, and progress labels.

How to view locally:
1. Open index.html in a browser (double-click or run a local server).
2. For best results, serve with a simple static server, e.g.:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Notes:
- The contact form is a demo and does not submit to a backend.
- Update resume.pdf in the project root to enable resume download.
